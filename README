This is a POC DNS poisoning (pharming) application. Put in the IP/hostname you want to redirect (can be easily found with a ping), and put in the box opposite that the IP/hostname you want to redirect to. Press File -> Compile and you will have a standalone app, which poisons the hosts file of the machine on which it is run on.

THIS IS FOR EXPERIMENTAL/EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY AS A POC ONLY

This will currently only affect XP machines. (70% of all computers).


DO NOT delete any files included with PoisonPhish, otherwise it will not work.

To use a custom icon for the compiled app, just place the ico file in the PoisonPhish directory and rename it to custom.ico.
